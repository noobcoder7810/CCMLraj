1. Introduction
We are predicting if a student is in a relationship based on survey data.

2. Data Cleaning
Filled missing values using:

Mean for G2, absences

Mode for famsize, fedu, freetime

Random “yes/no” for higher

Dropped rows where label (relationship) was missing.

3. Exploratory Analysis
Plotted distributions of features.

4. Model Training
Used Logistic Regression.
Tried multiple combinations of features.

5. Model Interpretation
Used SHAP for feature importance.

6. Conclusion
SHAP helps us explain the prediction clearly.
The model works decently and gives some insight.

SHAP helps us explain the prediction clearly.

It was a good learning experience in data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
